# OpenSAE



## Acknowledgements

This project draws inspiration from various third-party SAE (Sparse Autoencoder) tools. We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the following:

- [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) by HuggingFace: The architecture design of OpenSAE is significantly influenced by their implementation.
- [sparse_autoencoder](https://github.com/openai/sparse_autoencoder) by OpenAI: We have adapted their kernel implementation and some of their training tricks.
- [sae](https://github.com/EleutherAI/sae) by EleutherAI: Our training pipeline is largely inspired by their work.
We deeply appreciate the contributions of these projects to the open-source community, which have been invaluable to the development of this project.
